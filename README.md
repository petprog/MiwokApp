## Introduction to this exercise

## Introduction to this exercise

The name of the community is Dynamic Club. Dynamic Club is a community comprises of Engineering students majorly mechanical engineering students who aim to contribute to the technological development of the University.
The community was founded by class 17 of Mechanical Engineering. The community is made up of 60 students in which any student in the Faculty of Engineering can registered.

The club is an official club approved by the Head of Department of Mechanical Engineering and some of the lectures are willing to be our patrons.

We hold trainings for different softwares like Solidworks, Matlab, Arduino, Java, Python, Autocad. 

We have done some projects and represented the campus three times.

I am one of the executives, in which I am both serving as the project manager and design instructor who lead the design team and I also teach them how to code in java, python sometimes.

The community is full of brilliant people who hope to find solutions to the problems we face as undergradutes and later in life be the problem-solvers for the whole Africa. The community has few members and are planning that other faculties can join the community.

We schedule the meeting twice a week (Monday and Friday). On Monday, we discuss about the project on ground and those we have started but the duration of our meetings is not enough because we only have an hour to rub minds. Thirty minutes of the time is spent on suggestions, various activities we are committed to like going for competitions, the unfinished projects, budget planning, the other training(skills) and there is no time for the discussion of the project on ground.

I just think that if our community can start using GitHub as an extra platform to discuss on projects we left untouched. I am playing to create a kind of hackathon events for some days to train them on GitHub. 


## Introduce yourself

My name is Farinu Taiwo. I am a student of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Nigeria where I am curently pursuing my first degree in Mechanical Engineering. 
I love drawing 3D objects on paper when I'm in class. If I'm not busy with school work, I can code on Android Studio for like 7 hours learning and creating mobile apps. I am a tech enthusiast and I love talking about technology to my mates. I'm a person that believes using softwares to solve engineering problems than using manual approach. I love hearing and learning about politics.

I have a dream of becoming a game developer since high school. I started learning Python in my first year, then I move to Java programming in my second year. I am currently an android developer and Java expert. I have made some apps for myself, and I'm planning to make an app for my department and my school.

I think some students are not aware of how these technologies are made and they are not interested in the future of Africa. I love Africans to be the builders of technology and not the so called "Users of the Technology"


## Community Definition

How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

The community is not a computer science club in which only programmers and Software developers are gathered. It is a kind of special group of students whereby some are good in modelling of parts, programming, manufacturing process, building machines, theoretical analysis.

It is a formal recognized community. The club is an official club approved by the Head of Department of Mechanical Engineering and some of the lectures are willing to be one of our patrons.

The community share interest from a wide range of fields in engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, Electronics Engineering, . We focus on robotics, assemblying of parts, Innovations, Inventions.

The community was founded by department of Mechanical Engineering students of class 17 in the year 2015 when they went for are preparing for a nation engineering competition.

The community was of 12 members in since 2015 until 2017 when the founders were in their final year and they had to keep the community going. They informed us about the group they formed when they were in their 3rd year. I joined when I begin my 2nd year and we are now over fifty in numbers. Before this year ends, the community should have 80 members. 

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- We face problem when we are planning to go for competitions and we need to do the prototypes and the models of the machines. 
- We face problem when members are not familiar with softwares and they need it in thier department or try to use it to solve problem, we tried to organize trainings for them on those software.

## What is the mission of your community?

- Our aim is to inspire, empower, challenge and change the world.
- Our aim is to build and develop devices.
- Our aim is to heighten awareness.
- Our aim is to develop leadership skills.
- Our aim is to promote and foster unity through seminars, social gathering and excursion.


## What do members look to get from your community?

- Project exhibition, defending and development
- Launch initiative competition
- Engineering workshops


### Activities

- I am one of the executives, in which I am both serving as the project manager and design instructor who lead the design team and I also teach them how to code in java, python sometimes. I can represent them in any events where it is tech-oriented. I was a project manager at Hack for good 2018, 3dAfrica. I was at the program and we were Second Runner-up.

- With these, I think I am encourging others in my community to do more and more in technology. There will be more skills added to the those with single skill. 

### Communication

- I can get in touch with the community when we have our first meeting after resumption of next semester and during the engineering students experience we have started this month.

- We have a group on Whatsapp and we are planning to use text messages after our next meeting. Using Whatsapp is more economical and fast but we are planning text messages for those that do not have smart phones.

## Future-proofing your community

- Creating professionals before graduating from the campus.

### Agency

There is a lot of work to give the team.
- Giving them information to become experts in other platform (Autodesk, Solidwork, Android)
- Giving them personal projects
- Representing the community in different hackathons
- Teaching them Microsoft Office packages and how to apply it in their field of study.
- Given them talks on future of technology.
- Sharing this knowledge to them (this sweet training to become a GitHub campus expert)


### Mission

Keeping my mission clear and accessible to new community leaders will be a continous task until they can lead.

- We used to go to different levels (based on year spent in school) to tell them about Dynamic Club, so they already have idea about the the community.
- I will talk to them about our goals every year and we did in our time.
- I will create time to motivate them on the challenges we faced and how to prevent them.


### Structure

The type of structure that will be adopted are commitment and diligence in every meeting

The community leadership successors will be chosen based on their levels, skills, hard work, representing the community in competitions. They will be chosen based on an exam about the community.


- How will you handover to new community leaders?

The new community leaders will be handover when I am in my final year together with other executives.
